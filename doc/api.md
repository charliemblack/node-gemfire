# API Documentation

The documentation is broken down into seperate pages for thier respective classes.   The idea is how some of the other language tools have thier documentation generated.

This page serves as a jumping of point to those other pages and is an attempt a organizing those concepts into order in which those documentation pages are used.

* [GemFire](gemfire.md) - The JavaScript module.
* [CacheFactory](cache_factory) - An API to allow developers to configure the connection details (pool, timeouts, singlehop,...).
* [Cache](cache.md) - The class that enables functions to be called and regions to be created or discovered.
* [Region](region.md) - The data storage interface.
